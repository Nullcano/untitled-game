    name: 'Repair Shop',
    description: `You can't really tell what was once fixed in here, just that at one point all the machinery surrounding you worked. An upper ground-level floor contains a small office, and what once might have been some kind of waiting or break room, if the discarded beverage containers and old broken TV are any indicators.`
  }, {
    name: 'Open Wastes',
    description: `Desolate and still, all is quiet in this stretch of earth. Sandy plains extend for miles and miles, much further than the eye can see. Small shanty shacks and abandoned vehicles are sprinkled about, falling apart and barren. Littered about the arid desert are rows upon rows of large oil drills, much larger than the buildings, and covered from top to bottom in rust and decay.`
  }, {
    name: 'Beached Ship',
    description: `Its name faded from memory, now a barren and inhospitable wasteland of sand, heat, and death. In the far distance the corps of a long dead city peeks above the horizon as if a creature looking up from its hole to see if the winter has past. An ancient cargo ship lays beached. listing on its side, its containers spilled on the sand. The corroded steel fossil of a giant industrial beast.`
  }, {
    name: 'Fortified Cemetery',
    description: `This cemetery was converted into a defensive position. The wrought iron fence has been lined with scraps of steel and wood. Some graves cleared away for space for tents and a garden. The two crypts here have been re-purposed for sleeping and storage areas, and a single platform has been erected at the cemetery gates, likely for use as a watch tower.`
  }, {
    name: 'Health Clinic',
    description: `Gutted and torn, this old clinic was once part of another outdoor mall, but has been looted and ransacked so many times that only the faded lettering tells you what it once was.`
  }, {
    name: 'Shanty Town',
    description: `A cobbled collection of hand made huts and shacks pilled on top of each other is present in the distance. Whether it is inhabited by cautious survivors, savage zeds or even if it is eerily empty cannot be known from this distance.`
  }, {
    name: 'Fast Food Joint',
    description: `Time and war have destroyed any recognizable features of this forgotten shrine of easily-accessible food. Pastel-colored plastics litter the building, and the skitter of creatures that are new to this world can be heard in the shadows of the restaurant.`
  }, {
    name: 'Scrap Yard',
    description: `There are mountains of trash scattered around as far as the eye can see. Items ranging from broken vehicles, decrepit electronic devices and even the odd tool can be seen. There are piles upon piles of tires lying around, clearly too old to be of any use. The metal wire fence that encloses the scrapyard is rusting and , in some locations, nonexistent. These locations seem to methodological to be just from decay and it would be wise to get out before finding out what created those holes.`
  }, {
    name: 'Abandoned Highway',
    description: `A river of destroyed and now rusty old vehicles. The road is getting overgrown. Some areas are so dense with piled up cars and shrubs that it's hard to navigate through.`
